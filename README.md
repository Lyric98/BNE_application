## Installation

To install requirements:
```
$ conda env update -f environment.yml
$ conda activate BNE
```
This environment includes all necessary dependencies.

To create an `BNE` executable to run experiments, run `pip install -e .`.

## Part 1: Data

### Availability

For prediction files of air pollution models (MH2021, GS2018, and SK2020 to be used as base models for BNE ensemble), the dataset can be requested by following instructions of the respective websites:

For geographic data mapping, we utilized shapefiles provided by the United States Census Bureau, sourced from their Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) Geographic Information System (GIS) clearinghouse. These files can be accessed at the following URL: https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2015/shp/. The TIGER/Line shapefiles offer detailed and comprehensive geographic data that are essential for accurate mapping and spatial analysis.


### Description

#### File format(s)

The processed version of the above three base models’ prediction dataset are included in 
https://github.com/Lyric98/BNE_application/blob/master/data/training_dataset/training51.csv . We used this CSV file to processed our case study.

#### Data dictionary

In our case study, we processed the first 7 columns of the above CSV file and the Column Descriptions are as following:

* **mon_id**: Unique identifier for monitors' information (State-County-dentifier);
* **aqs**: This column refers to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) AQS data, which was downloaded from the USEPA's Air Data clearinghouse https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html ;
* **pred_av**: Predicted values from the base model "MH2021";
* **pred_gs**: Predicted values from the base model "GS2018";
* **pred_caces**: Predicted values from the base model "SK2020";
* **lon**: Longitude coordinates of the monitor stations;
* **lat**: Latitude coordinates of the monitor stations.

## Part 2: Code

The codebase includes modules to train BNE models using base model predictions and air pollution outcome (under [folder name]), and also jupyer notebooks for generating prediction and visualize results ([folder/file name]).  The detailed instructions for training code is in /[train_code_folder]/README.me, and the instructions for executing the jupyter notebook is contained in the notebook itself.




## Part 3: Reproducibility workflow

### Reproducibility 
Each Jupyter-notebook file (.ipynb) or Python file (.py) can be run independently to generate the examples, simulation experiment, or the case study. The R code can be run to prepare the data for the case study. Note that base data refers to data that the base models are trained on; train data refers to data that the ensemble is trained on, and test data refers to data that the ensemble is evaluated on. 

`BNE_examine.ipynb` includes all simulation codes (1D/2D toy models).

For the case study experiments, Table 4 and Table S3 are generated diretly from `DirectlyEnsembles.ipynb`; Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure S1 are generated by `BNE_1213.ipynb` and `BNE_spatialCV.ipynb`.

### Tuning Hyperparameters
```
python BNE_tune.py --bma_gp_lengthscale .05 --bma_gp_l2_regularizer 0.09 --bne_gp_lengthscale 4 --bne_gp_l2_regularizer 5
```
